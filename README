Scribble
========

The scribble package provides facilities for doing buffered log writes into Cassandra.

* scribble_server.py

    The scribble_server is a long running process that accepts client connections, buffers
    the client output and then dumps it to the Cassandra db periodically.

* scribble_client.py
    The scribble_client is a short-lived process whose purpose is to read from standard in
    and write to a scribble server running on the same machine.

* tail.py
    A simple utility that pulls logs out of Cassandra and writes them to stdout.  It behaves
    like 'tail -f', continually pulling more recent data and writing it to stdout.
